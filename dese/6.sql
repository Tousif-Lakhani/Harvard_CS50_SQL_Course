-- DESE wants to assess which schools achieved a 100% graduation rate.
-- In 6.sql, write a SQL query to find the names of schools (public or charter!) that reported a 100% graduation rate.

-- SELECT "school_id" FROM "graduation_rates"
-- WHERE "graduated" = 100;

SELECT "name" FROM "schools"
WHERE "id" in (
